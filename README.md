Iâ€™m a seasoned **Leader and Manager in Software Engineering**. I love creating great software to solve big problems. But what I love even more is assembling a group of talented people to tackle even bigger challenges.

>My mission is to help companies deliver solutions that make a difference to people.

With over 15 years of experience leading teams and building software, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to provide value from a wide variety of perspectives. Iâ€™ve worked with early-stage startups, medium-sized companies, consultancies, and large corporations. In each environment, Iâ€™ve found ways to drive impactful initiatives while surrounding myself with great people. Along the way, Iâ€™ve adapted, learned, and stayed true to my core values
